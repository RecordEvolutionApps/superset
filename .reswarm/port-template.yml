# Sample Ports template
#
# Defines the ports that a user of the app can enable access to.
# Can be used to serve a user interface to users.
############################################################

# Note: All ports are closed by default on a device.
# Note: Ports can potentially conflict with ports of other apps on the same device.
# Note: Using a tcp protocol you can also stream RTSP Video directly

ports:
  - name: Web interface       # Label of the port in the device's app settings
    port: 19999               # Port under which a web server provides a user interface
    main: true                # This is the port used for the quick-access icon on a device's app list
  - name: Video Stream
    port: 4443
    protocol: tcp             # Possible values: "http" | "https" | "tcp" | "udp" (default: "http")
                              # (This does not reflect the remote protocol, only the local protocol. Https is only neccessary if the local application is serving over https)
    remote_port_environment: EXAMPLE_ENV # Defines the environment variable name in which the remote port will be stored (TCP and UDP only)
