# Sample Data Template
#
# In this template you can describe the structure of the cloud data storage that the app can use to collect data from devices.
# You can define tables and their columns and you can additionally describe "transforms".
# Transformes are basically TimescaleDB SQL statements that can use the data in the defined tables to create and store aggregates.
# When a user installs this app on a device in his/her fleet, then these structures will be created in
# a TimescaleDB database in the cloud that is private to that fleet.
# To send data from a device to these tables in the cloud you can use the ironflock-py or ironflock-js libraries like this: 
# rw.publish_to_table('mytablename', {tsp: '2024-01-01T00:00:00', temperature: '22'})
# When you publish data to the table you are using a secure realm in the IronFlock WAMP Messaging Cluster that is private to the fleet.
# The data that you publish is mapped to the individual columns using the path property in the column definitions.
# Here the 'args' keyword represents the list of arguments following the tablename in the publish_to_table function.
